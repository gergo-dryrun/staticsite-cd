# Quickstart Hosting Static Site on AWS Part 2: CI/CD
###### Cloudformation stack suite to deploy AWS CodePipeline setup for static sites


This project includes a master CloudFormation template that bundles up independent stacks:

 * Service roles needed by CodePipeline CodeBuild and custom AWS Lambda function
 * CodePipeline setup with github commit trigger, CodeBuild and custom AWS Lambda publishing artifacts to s3.

#### Prerequisites

* You will need to have the infrastructure boilerplate configured as described in [Part 1](https://dryrun.cloud/2017/quickstart-hosting-static-site-on-aws-part-1-infrastructure/)
* Valid `buildspec.yaml` inside your staticsite github repository. See [jekyll sample](#buildspec)

#### Setup
You can get started by deploying the stack.

If you are not a big fan of launching stacks from the console, you can clone this repo and the `Makefile` should provide you with what you need. I recommend keeping the parameters somewhere secure due to the sensitive nature of the github token.

```bash
# To create stack
make STACK_NAME=staticsite-cd STACK=master PARAM_PATH=`pwd`/parameters REGION=us-west-1 create
# To poll for events
make STACK_NAME=staticsite-cd STACK=master REGION=us-east-1 watch
# To see the stack outputs
make STACK_NAME=staticsite-cd STACK=master REGION=us-east-1 output
# To update the stack
make STACK_NAME=staticsite-cd STACK=master PARAM_PATH=`pwd`/parameters REGION=us-east-1 update
# To delete the stack
make STACK_NAME=staticsite-cd REGION=us-east-1 delete
```

The master stack will create 2 stacks.

* `pipeline-roles.template` contains the minimum set of roles needed by AWS Services to do the work on your behalf. Soon enough we'll have [service linked roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-an-easier-way-to-delegate-permissions-to-aws-services-service-linked-roles/) for every AWS Service, which should greatly simplify or maybe even eliminate this template.
* `pipeline.template` contains the CodePipeline definition and custom lambda function for publishing files to s3.

### CodePipeline configuration

![CodePipeline](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dryrun.cloud-resources/2017-04-23-getting-started-static-sites-cd/screenshots/code-pipeline.png)

There are 3 mandatory stages:

* **Source**
* **Build**
* **Production**

If you opted for staging environment you will get another stage in between **Build** and **Production**, called **Staging** (I know, very inspired naming)

The **Source** stage is configured with your github repo token and every time you do a commit, the hook will trigger the pipeline.

 <a name="buildspec"></a> The **Build** stage uses CodeBuild to execute the commands defined in your `buildspec.yml`. It expects to find a `buildspec.yml` file at the root of the project.

```yaml
version: 0.0
containers:
    LambdaFunctions:
        phases:
            during_build:
                commands:
                    - gem install jekyll
                    - jekyll build
        artifacts:
            files:
                - _site/**/*
```

The **Staging** stage will invoke a lambda function, passing in the `_site.zip` artifact and s3 destination. The lambda unpacks the artifact and does an `aws s3 sync` with the staging bucket.

There's an additional `Manual Approval` step, which uses SNS to send an e-mail containing a hyperlink to the environment and awaits user response. This should be an IP whitelisted environment where you can validate that the site looks and behaves as you expect it to.

![Manual Approval](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dryrun.cloud-resources/2017-04-23-getting-started-static-sites-cd/screenshots/approval-mail.png)

You can `Reject` or `Approve` the changes, leaving a comment justifying the action.

If approved, the **Production** stage will invoke the same lambda but this time with the production bucket as destination.

And Voil√†!, your latest changes are live and the best part of it is that everything is automated, no more worrying about aws credentials and syncing up folders. Long live CodePipeline!

#### Tips & gotchas
Current setup expects that the result of your static site build process defined in [buildspec](#buildspec) generates a `_site` directory.

Depending on which jekyll template you use, the buildspec `commands` might also differ slightly, just use the ones that work on your local machine.

[Boto3 still does not](https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/358) have an equivalent of `aws s3 sync`. Luckily I already faced the challenge of porting [awscli to lambda](https://github.com/gergo-debreczeni/alfredbot/blob/master/alfred/alfred.py#L63), so that came in handy.
